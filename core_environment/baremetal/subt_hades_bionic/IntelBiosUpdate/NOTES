Copy HN0053.bio to a vfat/DOS formated USB stick.

Stick the USB stick in one of the rear USB ports (not sure why the front ports don't work) and boot the HADES from a powered off state. 

Press F2 during the boot to go into the BIOS. 

Press F7 and browse to the HN0053.bio on the USB stick. In my case it was fs0:\HN0053.bio .

Open that file. A few minutes later it should be done and reboot.
